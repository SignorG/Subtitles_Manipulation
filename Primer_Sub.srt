<i>(MAN) Here's what's going to happen.</i>

00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,047
<i>I'm gonna read this,
and you're gonna listen,</i>

at the top of the page.</i>

<i>Meticulous, yes.</i>

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,773
<i>Methodical. Educated.
They were these things.</i>

10
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,068
<i>Nothing extreme.
Like anyone, they varied.</i>

11
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,823
<i>There were days of mistakes
and laziness and infighting.</i>

12
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,910
<i>And there were days, good days,
when by anyone's judgement</i>

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,454
<i>they would have to be considered clever.</i>

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,874
<i>No one would say
that what they were doing was complicated.</i>

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,796
<i>It wouldn't even be considered new,
except for maybe in the geological sense.</i>

16
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,632
<i>They took from their surroundings
what was needed,</i>

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,259
<i>and made of it something more.</i>

18
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,970
- I extended that.
- Wait, what order date you put on this?

19
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,241
- (PHILLIP) The 28th. Why? What do you care?
- (ROBERT) I don't know...

20
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,100
- Yeah, I'm putting the 28th.
- Have you...

21
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,313
Have you thought any more
about what you want to put forward?

22
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,941
- Uh, not really.
- Because I was...

23
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,569
I mean, I haven't changed my mind
or anything.

24
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:54,656
Phillip and I were talking.
We think it'd be good. It'd be fun.

25
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,244
Look, nobody's saying it wouldn't be fun.

26
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,539
It's just, the time for jacking around
with Tesla coils

27
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,427
and ball lightning in the garage is over.

28
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,144
Maybe this is something you should try
on your own, in your free time, you know?

29
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,296
My free time? Which free time?
Free time after the 50 hours at work,

30
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,232
after the 30 hours
I already spend in that garage?

31
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,925
- We're all working the same schedule.
- (PHONE RINGING)

32
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,844
And it's not a Tesla coil.

33
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,573
I guess I could shave a couple of minutes
off my day by eating on the toilet.

34
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,837
Look, how many patents do we have?
In the last 14 months?

35
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,727
- Did you sign the agreement?
- Nobody signed the agreement.

36
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,788
It doesn't matter,
we're sticking to the agreement.

37
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,833
(ABE) Name one other thing that's come
out of that garage that's remotely profitable.

38
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,900
If you're talking about...

39
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,086
I don't see anybody quitting
their jobs because of it.

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,195
I know I'm not. Are you?

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,632
(AARON) I think Abe just means
that right now the JTAG cards are it.

42
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,656
And when you look
at the addresses on these things,

43
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,243
we have a lot of apartments,
a lot of residences.

44
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,288
But these are not the bulk orders
to OEMs or retail giants.

45
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,707
- These are the quiet basement...
- (ROBERT) Hackers.

46
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,211
Yeah, hacker wannabes
testing their dads' old motherboards.

47
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,591
And I know that a lot of that is my fault,
admittedly, you know.

48
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,387
With everything last year, and...
the doubletalk we were getting from Platts

49
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,722
and all the stuff
we're not going to get into now...

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,392
(PHILLIP) Maybe we should get into it.

51
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,477
I'm sorry. What?

52
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,147
(ROBERT) Go ahead. Tell him.

53
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,609
Maybe we should get into it.
I talked to my brother today.

54
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,486
He knows of at least two other cases.

55
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,839
We should at least let Platts know
we're talking about it.

56
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,532
Forget Platts.

57
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:22,119
This has got to start being about
what has the best chance of going to market,

58
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,538
and what is going to get us
that VC attention.

59
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,833
Look, I stuck by you guys
when it was your turn,

60
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,711
when I wasn't 100% sure
of what we were doing,

61
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,671
or even if I didn't agree, maybe.

62
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,256
(WATER RUNNING)

63
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:38,009
But if it's my turn,
if we're still playing by the rules,

64
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,845
then this is what I want to try.

65
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,638
(CROCKERY CLATTERING)

66
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,059
- (KARA) Here, take it.
- No, really.

67
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,103
Oh, Robert, please.
It's not going to hold.

68
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,606
- (ROBERT) It's going to go bad in my car.
- It'll go bad here. OK, thanks.

69
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,942
- Good night, y'all.
- See you.

70
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,780
We just got done
giving this huge speech about this.

71
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,384
- What, we gave a speech?
- We just got done. It was five minutes ago.

72
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,928
No, I gave a speech.
I'm the one who forced the issue, remember?

73
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,663
And in fact, you know, they're onto us
because I suck as a bad cop.

74
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,016
- I don't know about that.
- You should do it. You could fake it better.

75
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,226
I don't know about that either.

76
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,628
Look, as long as we're going down this road
where it's eighth-grade physics,

77
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,340
and happy fun time out in that garage,
I think we could stand to try this.

78
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,594
You know, Phillip and Robert
are gung-ho on theirs, and that's fine.

79
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,264
But you know I have no interest in that.
And I know you have no interest in that,

80
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,749
besides the fact that Phillip and Robert
don't even need us for what they want to do.

81
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,249
They just want to use the equipment.

82
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,897
For what I want to do?
We don't need them.

83
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,483
Not even Phillip,
cos it doesn't need software.

84
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,528
- Is she asleep?
- No, and she needs a bath.

85
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,864
She's gonna wind up
in the closet if I do it.

86
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,616
That's fine.

87
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,619
You know, even if Robert's OK with it,
and he won't be,

88
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,139
I don't even think I understand
what we're saying the thing's going to do.

89
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,266
I think we should let them go at it
for the next two months.

90
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,434
You know, they do theirs, we do ours.

91
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,186
(KARA) They said it'd take 14 hours
from the time we installed it.

92
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,337
Don't eat that.
Don't eat that. Seriously, it's bad.

93
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,862
We have to throw the first
couple of batches out. The filter.

94
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,591
What about crushed?

95
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,845
- (ROBERT) These guys are funded.
- These guys are... What?

96
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,183
- Liquid helium. These guys are funded.
- No, that's what this is, OK?

97
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,519
That's the whole difference.
That's what the box is.

98
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,206
This way we don't have to play
the game where we're going back and forth

99
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,750
coming up with new and innovative ways
to make the thing colder,

100
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,753
- and generally unusable in the process.
- (PHILLIP) Aaron, I need the hexagonal set.

101
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,821
- And unmarketable.
- Right, and unmarketable.

102
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,405
By coming at it from the back end,

103
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,908
see, rather than changing
the surrounding temperature,

104
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,929
we'll just change the level that it'll conduct,
the transition temperature.

105
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,579
And, see, by bombarding these edges...

106
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,724
What he's saying is, these guys,
they're dropping the ceramic,

107
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,124
the temperature lower and lower.

108
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,145
It makes the ceramic less resistant,
knocks out the interior magnetic field.

109
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,629
Exactly. What he's saying is...

110
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,173
What I'm saying is,
we drop the box down on it.

111
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,760
OK? Focus our own magnetic field to negate,
knock out with the inverse

112
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,696
- what's going on inside the ceramic.
- It's smart.

113
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,806
And that should change
the transition temperature

114
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,808
to something we can work with.

115
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,811
- What are we saying that is?
- Hopefully, near room temperature.

116
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,232
What is that about
the best mathematician is a lazy one?

117
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,193
- What did you ask for?
- (PHILLIP) I asked. I need the hexagonal set.

118
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,213
- What did you call it?
- (PHILLIP) Just come on.

119
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,840
- Are these Type One?
- The superconductors?

120
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,325
- (BOTH) Yeah, they're Type One.
- What? Is that going to be a problem?

121
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,203
There's plenty lying around at work,
but they're all bar-coded, so...

122
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,957
- if I have to buy the kits, I'll buy the kits.
- What are you doing about the source?

123
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,250
What?

124
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,004
- I can get them.
- You can... Are you sure?

125
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,889
I thought you didn't like this idea anyways.

126
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,068
If you gotta buy 'em, you gotta buy 'em,
but everything else we can take care of.

127
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,486
What are you doing about the source here?

128
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,054
You know that story
about how NASA spent millions of dollars

129
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,390
developing this pen that writes in zero-G?

130
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,017
- Did you ever read that?
- Yeah.

131
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,812
- And how Russia solved the problem?
- Yeah, they used a pencil.

132
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,856
Right, a normal wooden pencil.

133
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,874
It just seems like Phillip takes
the NASA route almost every time.

134
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,255
- It's a palladium, right?
- You got their diagram, what does it say?

135
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,281
They use a ratio of both,
platinum and palladium.

136
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,408
But I don't know if that's necessary.

137
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,012
I think they're just showing off.
If you have it, you gotta use it, right?

138
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,704
I want to get a replacement router.

139
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,683
- I'm putting down four ounces of palladium.
- (AARON) Did Robert look at it?

140
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,685
- Yeah, I already got his eye.
- (ROBERT) I can't fix it.

141
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,504
- OK. Where are you getting it?
- Wal-Mart. It's like $50.

142
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,382
- OK. Can you get a receipt, please?
- Yeah.

143
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,176
Platinum or palladium is less resistant?

144
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,594
- Abe.
- Just, it's not a...

145
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,572
Yeah, I don't care.
So resistance doesn't matter.

Well, yes. Yeah, I guess. Aye.

150
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,688
Well, then, which is cheaper?

151
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,482
You're not going to buy it, are you?

152
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,568
Well, unless you've got
a few grams of palladium lying around.

00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,256
I'm just saying, why would they put it in there
if you didn't need it?

155
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,492
One catalytic converter. It's fine.
Just remember to put it back, OK?

156
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,993
Your emissions went up 300%.

- Yeah, should be.

If not, we'll pull the one
out of my truck.

OK, copper tubing.

- Without the tubing?

- Yeah.

We can use the Freon, too.

No, no, wait, wait. Aaron, stop, stop.
I'll just buy the tubing.

Isn't there some sort of glass
or transparent...

00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,392
- I don't know.
- Anything we can use as a window? Pyrex?

190
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,686
- Yeah, I'm in.
- OK, drop it.

that's not going to leave a gap in the field.

But we got to see what's going on in there.

- How much did that cost?
- Yeah.

- What?
- You want to put my camcorder

a slightly negative pressure in the box.

- It's the blue one.

- I weighed it at 77 grams.

you bring it back,

00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,980
I mean, it's probably the batteries.

298
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,965
They're cheap batteries, you know,
probably not regulated right.

299
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,926
It is weird, though.

300
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,264
You want to see something weirder?

301
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,892
OK, let's go over this again.
Two batteries, right? 24 volts?

302
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,356
What are we pulling out of this one?
Just for fun.

303
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,859
Twelve volts.

304
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,373
- How about this one?
- Should be 12 volts.

305
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,717
So, what the hell is this thing?

306
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,387
It doesn't stay like that.

307
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,350
No, I mean, it winds down in a few minutes,
but what does that?

308
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,769
(MACHINE HUM FADING)

309
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,249
(AARON) I don't know.
I'll tell them something.

310
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,567
I'll tell them we're spraying
for bugs or something.

311
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,236
It should just be a day or two anyways.

312
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,589
- Unless you want to bring them in.
- No, no, it's just...

313
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,574
I mean, they have
their work in there, too.

314
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,927
You know, if Phillip finds out about that
or even sees it,

315
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,991
- he's going to have to take it apart.
- I'm just putting a love tweak on it.

316
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,748
Yeah, I know. No, you're right.

317
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,627
Abe, it's my garage, OK?
It's not like they're paying rent.

318
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,798
<i>(MAN) There was value in the thing, clearly.
That they were certain of.</i>

319
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,466
<i>But what is the application?</i>

320
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,512
<i>In a matter of hours, it was everything
from mass transit to satellite launching.</i>

321
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,015
<i>Imagining devices
the size of jumbo jets.</i>

322
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,268
<i>Everything would be cheaper.
It was practical, and they knew it.</i>

323
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,604
<i>But above all that,
beyond the positives,</i>

324
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,772
<i>they knew that the easiest way
to be exploited</i>

325
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,857
<i>is to sell something
they did not yet understand.</i>

326
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,568
<i>So they kept quiet.</i>

327
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:35,489
<i>The parties would continue.
Any birthday, anniversary, holiday,</i>

328
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,577
<i>maybe some obscure project launch,
it didn't matter. Any reason would do.</i>

329
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:44,290
<i>What was important is that Thomas Granger,
their last, best hope of funding, show up.</i>

330
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,834
<i>And if he left a little earlier
than they would've liked,</i>

331
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,544
<i>well, he couldn't be blamed.</i>

332
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,631
<i>He was only there
to please his daughter Rachel.</i>

333
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,342
<i>And she was only there to please Abe.</i>

334
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,888
Hey, what did you say
to Mr Granger earlier?

335
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,294
- Did you flip my burger?
- You can't call him Mr Granger.

336
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,142
You have to call him Thomas
or something.

337
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,104
- Go ahead, Robert. Flip it.
- No, because he won't take you seriously.

338
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,315
- He's my dad's age.
- But he thinks we're kids.

339
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,918
If you call him Mr Granger, he looks at you
like you're a six-year-old kid.

340
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,027
He does it with me.

341
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,780
- That's not going to work anymore.
- Why do you have to be so...

342
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:20,201
<i>(MAN) Abe had taken on the task
of quantifying and explaining the device.</i>

343
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,705
<i>But as weeks became months,
their enthusiasm became a slow realisation</i>

344
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,999
<i>that they were out of their depth.</i>

345
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,836
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

346
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,964
- Where'd you call?
- Your work and your cell.

347
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,133
I'm not there.

348
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,343
Really?

349
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,515
- March madness?
- It's Carolina and Michigan.

350
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,684
- Who's up?
- I don't even know. What?

351
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,438
Do you have anything important
at work today?

352
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,649
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

353
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,070
No, no. Just... Look, I was going to come
give you this big speech

354
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,199
about how we've been friends for a long time
and built up trust, and that whole big thing.

355
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,659
But how about this instead?

356
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:48,330
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things that I ask you,

357
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,167
I will in return show you
the most important thing

358
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,919
that any living organism
has ever witnessed.

359
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:59,842
- (AARON) Well, it looks like mustard to me.
- (ABE) I know, but it's a film.

360
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:04,013
It's a protein secreted by a fungus
called aspergillus ticor.

361
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,222
He told you that?

362
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,027
No, he knew it was a protein,
but he didn't know where it came from.

363
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,782
All he really did was just take some pictures
with their equipment.

364
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,713
- Hey, guess where we're going.
- Do you know where Will is?

365
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,274
No, why?

366
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,777
The Ariel meeting
is pushed back till Wednesday.

367
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,488
I just thought he was waiting around for it.
Where are you going?

368
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,823
What do they do with engineers
when they turn 40?

369
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,326
- What, Bradshaw?
- Exactly. You know what?

370
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,329
I do know where Will is.
I'll let him know on my way out, OK?

371
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,998
- OK.
- Thanks. Can you meet me out front?

372
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,168
- Are you gonna drive?
- OK, here. Take my keys.

373
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,255
OK, if you can just pretend
that this is the first time I came in.

374
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,551
And if you would
just tell him exactly what you told me...

375
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,055
- OK, so what is it?
- Protein build-up.

376
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,057
(ABE) OK, can you just tell him?

377
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,102
- Protein build-up.
- (ABE) But what kind?

378
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,480
Some fungus. Some fungus.

379
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,065
Where did it come from?

380
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,359
I don't know.
You were supposed to take it to the lab.

381
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,194
Yeah, that's next.

382
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,988
- You were in design, weren't you?
- Yeah.

383
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,241
How did you get over here?

384
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,701
You know what they do
with engineers when they turn 40?

385
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,079
They take them out and shoot them.

386
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,249
What the hell, Abe?
You could've just shown me the pictures.

387
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,668
I want you to believe it.

388
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,963
- Believe what, the protein? I believe you.
- OK, look.

389
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,758
This guy already thinks it's a joke, OK?
So he may be a little defensive.

390
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,969
Really? Why would he think that?

391
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,191
Please.

392
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,945
Aspergillus ticor.

393
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,489
This is a fungus that's everywhere.

394
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,786
It's in our bed, on our skin,
sometimes even our GI tract. Everywhere.

395
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,539
It's basically the reason
you don't leave things

396
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,916
in dark, damp, closed-off places.

397
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,418
Thank you.

398
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,086
Do you have that sample I brought?

399
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,011
(ABE) There it is. Terger. T-E-R-G-E-R.

400
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,724
OK, when I showed you this,
tell him what you thought.

401
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,478
You thought it was a joke, right?

402
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,272
It is a joke.

403
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,691
Right, but how did you know?

404
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,821
Will you show him? Please?

405
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,416
This is how I get protein A
out of aspergillus ticor.

406
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,378
We sweeten it, we agitate it,
we spin it around, we sweeten some more.

407
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,632
- Takes about a month.
- To get the same amount I brought in.

408
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,259
To get the same amount I brought in.

409
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,803
(AARON) So if it's an incubator for fungus,
is that valuable?

410
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,609
- That's not what it is.
- Then what is it?

411
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:55,017
There's one other way it could secrete
that much protein. It could do it naturally.

412
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,519
But that takes a lot longer.
A lot longer.

413
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,564
But if it has a little moisture
and it's left alone,

414
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,193
it'll start secreting and it'll build up
and build up, but it takes a long time.

415
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,611
- How long?
- A long time.

416
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:06,838
- More than a few days?
- Yes.

417
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,155
Then how long?

418
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,400
He says to get the same amount of protein
that we had,

419
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,576
the same amount
that I was wiping off every five days

420
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,912
and five days later it would accumulate,

421
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,831
he says it would take about
five to six years.

422
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,226
- I want to belittle this guy.
- Exactly.

423
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,380
So I said screw it,
and I put my watch in there.

424
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,217
- And?
- I want you to do it.

425
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,428
- Where is it? The box?
- I took it back to the shop.

426
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,892
- Wait, digital or old mechanical?
- Exactly. I did both.

427
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,188
- And what?
- I want you to do it.

428
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,359
(ABE) We thought that we were
degrading gravity, right?

429
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,778
That we were blocking that information.

430
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,490
But I think we're doing more than that.
I think we're blocking more than that.

431
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,575
Did you notice
when you were controlling the feed,

432
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,744
did you notice it was parabolic?

433
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,289
OK, it's important.
Parabolas are important. Here, look at this.

434
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,291
I don't know, Abe.

435
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:05,379
Now I'm going to start it up and let it run
for 60 seconds with nothing in it, OK?

436
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,297
- It's empty this time.
- That's 22...

437
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,903
In all the equations that describe motion
and heat and entropy.

438
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,301
Just one minute. Just a second.

439
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,155
In all Feynman diagrams, what's the one
variable that you can turn negative

440
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,490
and still get rational answers for?

441
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,534
- One minute out here...
- It's not mass, it's not...

442
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,811
- 22 hours, 27 minutes in the box.
- It's odd, it's an odd number.

443
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,856
How many minutes is that?
That's 1,347 minutes.

444
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,442
OK, yeah, 1,347, man,
you got that fast.

445
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,360
Why is it odd?
How'd you know it was odd?

446
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,404
Because this is it, OK?
This is what's going on.

447
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,656
There's an "A" end and there's a "B" end.

448
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,743
Let's say the "A" end is 12:00
and the "B" end is 12:01.

449
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,704
All right? We start the machine
with the weeble at the "A" end.

450
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,914
- It travels forward...
- You got to write this down.

451
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,184
- Aaron, there's nothing to write down.
- I'm writing it down.

452
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,335
Fine, it travels forward
normally towards the "B" end,

453
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,921
and when it gets there,
the feed runs down parabolically

454
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,207
until it should stop, but it doesn't.
It curves back around towards the "A" end.

455
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,870
When it gets back to the "A" end...
Now, curve that around.

456
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:58,098
OK, now the weeble has experienced
a total of two minutes, and again it curves...

457
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,100
(AARON) Back around. It curves parabolically.

458
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,145
Right. So, it comes back around again,
and it does this about 1,300 times,

459
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,980
and when it finally exits on the "B" end,

460
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,417
it's travelled an odd number
of forward and backward trips.

461
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:11,070
Now, what is so special about 1,300?
Why is it about 1,300? Why isn't it exact?

462
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,739
- This is not empirical.
- Here, give me that.

463
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:17,576
I don't know why it's not exact.
There's some sort of probability there.

464
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,496
OK, every time it hits the "B" end
there's a chance, OK?

465
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,123
A small chance it won't
curve back around towards the "A" end.

466
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,293
And for some reason, it takes about
1,300 trips before it finally does.

467
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,464
But it does have to exit, or else we wouldn't
be able to see it afterwards.

468
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,716
OK, let's take a look at this.

469
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,344
Yeah, 22 hours, 14 minutes.

470
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,642
1,334 minutes.

471
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,310
Even.

472
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,396
Enter at the "B" end.

473
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,526
Exit at the "B" end.

474
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,590
(ABE) I just want you to see it
the way I saw it.

475
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,116
I am trying, OK? I really am, here.

476
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,636
Look, everything we're putting in that box
becomes ungrounded.

477
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,621
And I don't mean grounded like to the earth.
I mean, not tethered.

478
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,666
We're blocking whatever keeps them
moving forward, so they flip-flop.

479
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,627
Inside the box, it's like a street,
and both ends are cul-de-sacs.

480
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,004
I mean, this isn't frame dragging
or Wormhole matching.

481
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,050
- This is Basic Mechanics and Heat 101.
- This is not mechanics and heat.

482
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,181
We can publish.

483
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,185
- Yeah, we can publish.
- No, I mean we can really publish.

484
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,981
Aaron, the weeble's stupid.
It can't move.

485
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,483
I mean, even if we were
to put the weeble in at point "B"

486
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,586
it's still just going
to bounce around back and forth,

487
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,821
until it gets kicked out at the "B" end.

488
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,660
But if it were smart...

489
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:47,457
it could enter at the "B" end
and exit at the "A" end before it flips back.

490
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,173
You're talking about making a bigger one.

491
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,898
You're talking about
making a bigger one.

492
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,677
I... I didn't say anything.

493
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,221
You're the one talking about it.

494
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,891
So, you believe me?

495
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,019
No, I don't.

496
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:10,480
- Come on. Let's go get a drink or something.
- Yeah.

497
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,446
- (AARON) We're going to have to move it.
- We will.

498
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,563
We need a box big enough
for a person to fit into, right?

499
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,784
As far as turning it on...

500
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,930
(ABE) I was testing the box. It turns out
that over half the rings are redundant.

501
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,184
The inner ring is strong enough on its own,
so it actually makes the plate smaller.

502
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,935
- No.
- And there's a lot more that's unnecessary.

503
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,004
Look, what we can do
is take a lot of these small plates

504
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,465
and surround a container
with a web of them.

505
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,800
How small?

506
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,636
Well, I mean,
it should be accumulative,

507
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,555
So a lot of mini-fields
equal one big one, right?

508
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,849
Yeah, I mean, yeah.
Sum of series, that makes sense.

509
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,204
What I was going to say though, is we need
to find some place where we can put it,

510
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,146
and turn it on and it won't be disturbed.

511
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,591
- I mean some place...
- We could just lock it in a closet.

512
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,816
No, safer than a closet.

513
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,754
Some place where someone's not going to go
poking around and messing with it.

514
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,780
And climate-controlled.

515
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,491
Yeah, yeah, so whatever,
we'll find some place.

516
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,702
But I mean, so, if we go your route,
with what, a bunch of mini-fields?

517
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,373
That's a lot of work. We'd have to...
I mean, how many days is that?

518
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,710
Abe, you know what we could use?
You know what we could use?

519
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,003
What?

520
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,340
I know we've seen
a lot of crazy things lately, OK?

521
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,236
And I know you're still trying to put it
all together in a way that makes sense.

522
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,695
- But you got everything.
- No, no, I don't.

523
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,431
Look, I just want you to understand
that what's next is not a prank, OK?

524
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,059
I wouldn't do that to you,
and I'm not doing that to you.

525
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,579
- So when you see this, you can't yell...
- Did you bring one with you?

526
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,356
...or make any noise or run anywhere. OK?

527
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,834
I know you probably feel
like you're being tricked or made fun of.

528
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,903
But you're not, OK?
I promise you. You're not.

529
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,072
OK?

530
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,474
Who was that, Abe?

531
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,208
Let's just wait.

532
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,877
Six minutes.

533
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,439
Look, you sure you're OK to drive?

534
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,570
What did you do all day?
The first time through?

535
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,372
I spent the day
in a hotel room in Russelfield.

536
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,872
- Look, I'll just meet you back at the shop.
- Wonder what I did.

537
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,545
- Guess I went back to work.
- Yeah, probably.

538
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,963
Probably just worked, I guess.

539
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,425
Yeah, probably so.

540
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,597
Look, now that I know about this, Abe...

541
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,182
(PHONE RINGING)

542
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,309
Don't do this again, OK?
Not where it affects me.

543
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,816
Go ahead.

544
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,157
Hi, Rachel.

545
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,457
(AARON MUMBLING)

546
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,167
(WATER RUNNING)

547
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,409
Why not the lottery?

548
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,162
Well, we can if you want,
but it's not till Saturday.

549
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,723
But even if we win the full $10 million,

550
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,142
it's only a couple of hundred thousand a year
for, what, the next 30 years?

551
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,792
Only.

552
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,670
- And that's just one good trade.
- A couple of days like this.

553
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,756
That was just running a test.
In and out.

554
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,717
OK. Well, I want to do what you did.
OK? Exactly what you did.

555
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,802
(ABE) OK, the first thing I did
is call in sick.

556
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,648
- (AARON) OK, I did that.
- And then I drove to the storage facility.

557
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,766
OK, but I need to drop
Lauren off at school first.

558
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,435
OK, then meet me there.
We're going to need both cars.

559
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,247
But we need to park yours way down
the road, out of sight of the facility.

560
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,608
- Wait, why are we doing that?
- Because we need a ride home.

561
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,443
- What is that...
- No, it'll make sense.

562
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,278
OK, I'll be patient.

563
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,115
When I got to the storage room,
I flooded the box with argon,

564
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:58,453
and then I had to tighten it up
to secure the leaks.

565
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,081
- There's leaks?
- There's always leaks.

566
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:09,714
At 8:30am I set the timer for 15 minutes,

567
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,342
I jumped in the car,
and drove to Russelfield.

568
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,637
- OK, I lost it.
- What?

569
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,763
Why the timer?

570
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,599
Because the moment
we start those machines

571
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,352
is the moment we'll end up
getting out of them, and...

572
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,562
Right. Got it. Sorry.

573
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,498
I don't want to be standing around
when they do.

574
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,565
Yep.

575
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:32,529
(ABE) While I was on the road at 8:45,
the machine kicked on by itself, and...

576
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,949
by 8:49 it was completely warmed up.

577
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:49,546
In Russelfield I got a hotel room
and tried to isolate myself.

578
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,381
Wait, what do you mean, "isolate"?

579
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,092
I mean, I closed the windows,
I unplugged everything in the room,

580
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,344
the telephone,
TV, clock, radio, everything.

581
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,431
I didn't want to take the chance
of running into someone I knew,

582
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,316
or seeing something
on the news that might...

583
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:05,895
If we're dealing with causality,
and I don't even know for sure...

584
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,064
- I just..
- What?

585
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,025
Took myself out of the equation.

586
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,569
- (AARON) Err on the side of caution.
- Yes.

587
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,572
Well, then what did you do all clay?

588
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,745
I just sat there.
I mean, I had some books, but...

589
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,055
(AARON) What? Were you nervous?

590
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,333
Yeah. It's just mind-numbing,
all the second-guessing.

Evacipate.

592
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,056
At 2:30pm,
I stopped by Williams Medical Supply,

593
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,516
and picked up a class "E"
oxygen tank and mask.

594
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,145
I called my mutual fund company
and asked which stock in their mid-cap fund

595
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,147
had the greatest percentage gain that day.

596
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,150
The idea was just to get enough information
for one good trade.

597
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,087
(AARON) When we go, can we just download
chart data? Trade on each movement?

598
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,711
Yeah, but if we do that,
I want to use the library in Russelfield,

599
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,658
use their computers.

600
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,593
So, I got to the storage room at about 3:15,
and out off the power to the box.

601
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,721
It cycled down
to a tolerable level at about 3:19.

602
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,325
You see, the trick is to get in
after it reaches a comfortable level,

603
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:28,269
but before it shuts off completely.
There's a window there.

604
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,230
So, does it hurt?

605
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,692
Yeah. Yeah, it does a little.

606
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,902
It's not bad, though,
if you wait for the right time.

607
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,197
It's like a small static shock.
Once you're in, you're fine, though.

608

609
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,615

And I can only assume that you don't have

610
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,745
cancer or male impotence because of it.

611
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,182
But I mean, what is your opinion
on how safe this thing is?

612
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,917
Aaron, I can imagine no way
in which this thing would be considered

613
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,169
anywhere remotely close to safe.

614
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,798
All I know is I spent six hours in there,
and I'm still alive.

615
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,177

(MACHINE HUMMING)

618
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:21,281
I set the alarm on my stopwatch
for six hours.

619
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:25,577
I regulated the O2 tank,
took some Dramamine and tried to sleep.

620
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:26,745
Did you?

621
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,539
- What?
- Did you sleep?

622
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,040
Not at first.

623
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,501
You know, I've never considered
myself claustrophobic,

624
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,547
but I started sweating and I couldn't find
the right flow rate on the tank,

625
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,091
and I was breathing a lot differently

626
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,552
than I was when I was testing it
on the outside.

627
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,138
Eventually, I settled down, and...

628
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,303
I don't know,
maybe it was the Dramamine kicking in,

629
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,101
but I remember this moment in there,
in the dark,

630
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,771
with the reverberation of the machine.

631
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,940
It was maybe the most content
I've ever been.

632
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,739
I woke up on my own without the alarm
and waited for the machine to cool down.

633
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,991
Cool down from my perspective.

634
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,660
It got to a point
where it sounded safe to get out

635
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,472
but the stopwatch still showed
a couple minutes

636
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,540
so I trusted the math and waited.

All right. Give me a few minutes.

646
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,988
(ABE) From there it was easy.
The bulk of the work was done.

647
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,715
I just left everything the way I found it.

648
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,701
I left the machine alone
and didn't turn it off or anything,

649
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,119
and just cleared out of there.

650
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,872
(AARON) OK, so that way,
your double would find everything

651
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,999
exactly the same later that day
and get in the box?

652
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:39,252
Right, right, but also, at that point,
I or my double or someone

653
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,657
was in the box coming backwards.

654
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,923
So who knows what that would've done
if I would have turned the machine off.

655
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,509
(AARON) Definitely. Definitely.
So, they're one-time use only.

656

was on the way to the hotel room in my car,

00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,559
I had to take a taxi home. But when we go,

00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,129

to buy as many shares as we can of RGWU.

All that matters is that the price goes up.

666
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,626
And the volume is so high
that the number of shares we're trading

667
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,360
is not going to affect the price.

- This is what I would do.

698
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,777
I would wake up tomorrow morning
and I'd go over to Gabriel Capital Inc.

And I would tell Joseph Platts' receptionist
that I'm there to see him.

And when he comes out,

00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,495
I would ram my fist
through the flat of his nose.

- I'd only do it though if I knew that

you know, no one would find out
or get hurt or anything.

707
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,765
Like, I wish that there was a way
that I could do it,

708
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,684
and, uh, go back and tell myself not to.

on not doing this, OK?

your double, from hitting Platts,

get back in the box?

How would you do it?

728
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,242

00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,293
I'm not going to pretend like I know
anything about paradoxes, you know?

732

735
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,154
- I don't know, man.
- Look, this is what I know for sure, OK?

736
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,804
About the worst thing in the world

737
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,891
is to know that the moment you're
experiencing has already been defined,

738
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:49,187
that this is the second or third time through,
or whatever, and...

739
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,981
do you ever feel, you know, like...

740
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,359
I don't know, maybe things aren't right,
like maybe your life is in disarray

741
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,546
or just not what you would like
and you start to wonder, you know,

742
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,822
"What caused this?
How did things get like this?"

743
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,868
You know, people are always
blaming their parents, you know,

744
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:07,181
as if their mom would have breastfed them,
their lives would have turned out different.

745
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,373
- Bunch of whiners.
- Yeah, they're a bunch of whiners.

746
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,476
But what if it wasn't
something you wondered about.

747
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,271
What if you knew for sure this is not the way
things are supposed to be.

748
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,504
I'm not like that.

749
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,270
I'm not into the whole
"destiny, there's-only-one-right-way" thing.

750
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,218
Abe, I'm not, either, OK?
But what's worse?

751
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:23,638
You know, thinking you're being paranoid
or knowing you should be?

752
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,104
You don't have to look at me like that.
I'm OK.

753
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,614
(ABE) No, I just assumed that you would.
I mean, I trust her.

754
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,449
I know that when I decided to tell you...

755
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,178
- Not that I was ever thinking of not...
- Decided to tell me? Thank you.

756
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,513
I just knew that you're married
and that there's no secrets,

757
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,665
and anything I tell you, she'll know.

758
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,351
- It's not a matter of trust.
- No, I know.

759
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,253
It's just how much better will it be
if in a few days, you know,

760
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:58,547
I surprise her and we all just fly to Costa Rica
or somewhere for a month?

761
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,633
You know,
we'll let her understand it gradually.

762
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,403
- Maybe do some real estate shopping...
- For now, though, if you wanted to,

763
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,239
you can just tell her
you had a good day in the market.

764
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,514
You don't understand. No.

765
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,825
You don't understand the questions
that come with that, OK?

766
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,969
But we'll explain it to her,

767
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,419
and we'll all just take some time
to figure out what's next,

768
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,147
which, right away I think,
should be building a bigger box,

769
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,708
like the size of a room or something,

770
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,693
at least more than one person
could fit into it.

771
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,487
Safe or not,
the thing feels like a coffin the way it is.

772
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,115
By the way, this is our guy.

773
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,534
What's the volume?

774
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,995
Five-and-a-half.

775
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,290
What's the return? Holy...

776
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,711
Yeah. No, I can't beat that.

777
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,606
But mainly, I guess I was just talking
about Robert and Phillip, you know.

778
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,798
I don't want to tell them.

779
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,151
I know they have a lot invested
in the group, and I just...

780
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,552
I don't want to tell them.

781
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,471
Abe, if you need me
to take the guilt on this one, fine.

782
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,016
OK? I accept it gladly. It's mine.

783
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,581
At the end of this week,
they can have whatever they want, OK?

784
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,563
I'll turn over patent rights
on everything from the last two years.

785
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:58,524
They can have the equipment,
the garage, the house.

786
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,235
They can have my truck
if that makes you feel better, OK?

787
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,447
But I am not telling them a thing about this.
We're not.

788
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,589
(AARON) God,
everything is so different in there.

789
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,050
You can feel how cut off you are,
you know.

790
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,053
It's this entirely separate world
and you encompass most of it.

791
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,431
(ABE) And the sound.
Isn't the sound different on the inside?

792
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:34,101
It's like it's singing.
I guess you can't hear it on the outside...

793
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,479
I had this dream in there.

794
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,565
- About what?
- (SIGHS)

795
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,653
I was on or near the ocean,
and I just kept hearing the surf.

796
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,156
It was so uneventful.

797
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,368
At night.
And the tide kept coming in and out.

798
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,120
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

799
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,800
Hey, whoa, come here for a second, man.
What's on your hand?

800
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,094
- Are you bleeding?
- That is blood.

801
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,887
- Turn around.
- You see it?

802
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,181
- Where is it coming from?
- It's your notebook.

803
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,933
- Aaron, it's you.
- What is this?

804
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,436
My gosh, it's on your ear.
Your ear's bleeding. Man.

805
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,064
Give me that. I got it.

806
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:26,445
- Is that normal? This isn't normal.
- For the machine?

807
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,906
No, for people.
You think it's the machine?

808
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,533
I got it.

809
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,844
Great. We can actually
get some work done today.

810
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,470
Hi, guys. What's going on?

811
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,740
I always seem to get a lot more done
when I'm not locked out.

812
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,484
(ABE) Yeah.
He said they had to spray again.

813
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,811
Yeah. But he can't tell us about it
in advance. ls hero even here?

814
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,456
Besides, you never see anything
around here but those geckos, anyway.

815
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,208
- Oh, I know.
- Yeah, I think it's for the geckos.

816
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,608
- (BOTH) What?
- (PHILLIP) Why?

817
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,420
(ROBERT) Oh, hey, man,
thanks for the present.

818
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,279
Yeah... yeah,
how is that working out for you?

819
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,531
You know what?
You guys, both of you,

820
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,260
- you make fun, but there is a difference.
- Wait. What did you call him?

821
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,053
- What?
- When you walked in? What did you say?

822
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,871
- He really didn't tell you about it?
- No.

823
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:21,125
All right. Rachel's ex-boyfriend
walks into my birthday party with a shotgun.

824
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,960
- What?
- Swear to God.

825
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,480
(AARON) Yeah, Abe.
I've already gotten that speech from Kara.

826
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,007
You're going to get it from me.
You have a wife and kid.

827
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,694
It's funny how you two are the only people
who have a problem with it.

828
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,071
- Everybody else thinks I did a good thing.
- Well, you didn't.

829
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,348
You can't go risking your life and especially
the welfare of Kara and Lauren

830
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,808
for someone like Rachel.

831
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,744
She practically begged
for this to happen to her.

832
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,408
I figured at least you'd understand this.

833
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,606
Understand what?
You've never been like this.

834
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,399
That's what I mean. You see...

835
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,985
You see how different things are now.

836
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,570
Different?
How are things different?

837
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,699
You see it, OK? I know you do.

838
00:49:56,619 --> 00:50:00,623
Look, that was the night you had told me
everything about the machine, OK?

839
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,958
And everything you told me
was so fresh in my head,

840
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,503
and when I saw this guy,

841
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,898
you know, I'm looking at him.
I wasn't going to let him do that.

842
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,716
I wasn't going to let him
scare people like that. And I...

843
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,760
I know it was stupid, OK?

844
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:16,263
But, I mean, this whole idea,
this whole thing that we're doing...

845
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,468
it just took some getting used to for me.
I wasn't completely acclimated to it.

846
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,437
OK. If it was just you
you had to worry about,

847
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,941
you know, I'd still think you're stupid.
But now, you have a family now.

848
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,711
And God, especially now,
to risk anything would be completely crazy.

849
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,861
I know, OK?

850
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,340
And the thing is,
I know you know that, but you've got to...

851

Even if you see him, don't tell me.

855
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,793
It's not my fault if I don't know.
I just hope the thing runs away.

856

Then what are we doing out here?

so you look for the cat. It's what you do.

- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

do they both ring at the same time,

(GAS HISSING)

1030
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,840
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

1031
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,551
Really?

1032
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,137
Your cell and work.

1033
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,769
- I'm not there.
- Really?

1034
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,152
I don't even know. What?

1035
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,072
I'm just tired.

1036
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:49,701
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

1037
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,067
<i>(ABE) I was going to come
give you this big speech</i>

1038
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:09,346
<i>about how we've been friends for a long time
and built up trust, and that whole thing.</i>

1039
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,764
<i>But how about this instead?</i>

1040
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:15,518
<i>If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things that I ask you,</i>

1041
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,313
<i>I will in return show you
the most important thing</i>

1042
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:20,482
<i>that any living organism
has ever witnessed.</i>

1043
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:26,738
<i>(MAN) At this point there would
have been some discussion.</i>

1044
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,285
<i>Abe would, of course,
want to know how.</i>

1045
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:37,624
<i>Aaron would have to explain
all about the storage manifest</i>

1046
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:41,086
<i>and how it showed two rooms
under the name Abram Terger.</i>

1047
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,923
<i>Then Abe would need to know how.</i>

1048
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,343
<i>Aaron would explain
that when he went up there</i>

1049
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,428
<i>and found the failsafe running,</i>

1050
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,347
<i>he knew exactly what it was.</i>

1051
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,726
<i>But Abe would ask, "How?"</i>

1052
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,813
<i>And then the bit
about the modular design of the coffins,</i>

1053
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:02,738
<i>and how it meant he could fold one up
and take it back inside another.</i>

1054
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:08,446
<i>They are not one-time use only.
They are recyclable, Aaron would say.</i>

1055
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,413
<i>"How?" Abe would ask.</i>

1056
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,210
<i>And Aaron would describe
how simple things become</i>

1057
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,089
<i>when you know precisely
what someone will have for breakfast</i>

1058
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,842
<i>even in a world of tamper-proof lids.</i>

1059
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,199
<i>How?</i>

1060
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,703
<i>And that's where
I would have entered the story.</i>

1061
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:58,872
<i>Or exited, depending on your reference.</i>

1062
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,420
<i>Because when Aaron came back
the second time, it wasn't so easy.</i>

1063
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,883
<i>He wasn't expecting me
to put up a fight,</i>

1064
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,969
<i>and by that time
he was too exhausted to take me.</i>

1065
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:17,974
<i>But for reasons
that are only evident to me now,</i>

1066
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:22,812
<i>I understood that he simply wanted it more.
That he just had more invested.</i>

1067
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,564
<i>So I left.</i>

1068
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:27,775
<i>He had already performed the task,
as I had intended to,</i>

1069
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:31,404
<i>of recording the conversations of the day,
just in case.</i>

1070
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:34,491
<i>Through that earpiece
he had a three-second lead on the world.</i>

1071
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:37,452
Aaron, you need some sleep.
Some real sleep.

1072
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,705
I can't. I've got a schedule.

1073
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,001
<i>He had but to speak aloud the words
that came into his head,</i>

1074
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,837
<i>and those around him would fall in line.</i>

1075
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,443
<i>(AARON ON EARPIECE) This is track 3.</i>

1076
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,988
<i>Abe is bringing my car around
and I'm on my way to the court.</i>

1077
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,323
<i>I'll see Will there.</i>

1078
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,660
<i>I'll invite him to the party and make sure
he's bringing Rachel's boyfriend.</i>

1079
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,829
<i>- 'Hey, Will.'
- 'Hey.</i>

1080
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,207
- (AARON) Will, hey.
<i>- (WILL) You pretentious prick!</i>

1081
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,085
You pretentious prick.
What the hell is that? Your cell phone?

1082
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,504
- No, it's a radio.
<i>- 'You look like secret service.</i>

1083
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:32,924
- You look like secret service.
- Ariel meeting is moved to Wednesday.

1084
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,176
What? What the hell
am I hanging around here for?

1085
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,888
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
<i>- (WILL) Nice shot, Aaron.</i>

1086
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,685
Prick. That is ugly, Aaron.

1087
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,746
<i>(WILL) We could have used
that last week against TI.</i>

1088
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,289
(WILL) At least you've got
your golf game, right?

1089
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,541
<i>I see you've been practising.</i>

1090
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,252
You come out here with your $3-tie
and think you can play white ball.

1091
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,754
- Don't worry, I'm not going to tell anyone.
<i>- (AARON) What are you doing tonight?</i>

1092
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,488
Hey. What are you doing tonight?

1093
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,633
I was supposed to be in Raleigh,
but thanks to you guys I missed my flight.

1094
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,242
- You know Robert?
- Yeah.

1095
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,744
He's got a birthday tonight.
Why don't you come out?

1096
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:05,873
- I'm just going to hang out with my cousin.
- Bring him. Rachel will be there.

1097
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,834
- Oh, big reunion.
- Exactly.

1098
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,669
That should be fun.

1099
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,185
I don't think I'm doing this.

1100
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:29,689
Why not?

1101
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:33,586
Because I can think of about a million
different ways that this can happen

1102
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,820
and nobody comes anywhere near
getting hurt.

1103
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,197
I can call her and see
if she wants to do something else

1104
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:41,468
or better yet, not even talk to her at all,
and she won't even know about the party.

1105
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,252
That's good for tonight.
What about tomorrow?

1106
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:45,788
- And every other day?
- I'll take care of tomorrow, tomorrow.

1107
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,373
Yeah, you'll watch her all the time.

1108
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,917
This guy is crazy enough
to walk into a roomful of people

1109
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,210
waving a shotgun around.

1110
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:53,776
What do you think he's going to do
if he ever finds her alone?

1111
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,383
This way we know exactly what happens.
We have complete control over it.

1112
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:00,595
At the end of the night,
this guy is arrested and goes to jail.

1113
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,306
That's the way it goes.
Your words, not mine.

1114
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:05,266
Now come on. It has to be you.

1115
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:08,186
She said she was there because
you told her you would be there.

1116
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:17,528
Don't tell me I came back
and did this for nothing.

1117
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,076
He doesn't fire?

1118
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:26,829
- No. He didn't fire.
- Not even when you rushed him?

1119
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,474
No, he didn't the time I wasn't there.

1120
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,668
He didn't the time I was,
when I rushed him.

1121
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,937
And from what Robert tells you,
he didn't do it tonight.

1122
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,756
He doesn't have the nerve. I mean the guy...
We know everything.

1123
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,925
OK? We're prescient.

1124
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,766
We can still be careful.

1125
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,771
Maybe we can get to the gun
without him knowing.

1126
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:53,231
We definitely can.
He leaves it in the truck before he goes in.

1127
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:56,192
I mean, we don't even need to,
but if it makes you feel better...

1128
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,610
What's wrong with our hands?

1129
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,407
What do you mean?

1130
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,659
Why can't we write like normal people?

1131
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:10,289
I don't know.
I can see the letters.

1132
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:16,462
I know what they should look like.
I just can't get my hand to make them easily.

1133
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,757
Try comparing it to your left hand.
That looks the same.

1134
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,342
(PHONE RINGING)

1135
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,561
Hey, Rachel.

1136
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,733
Yeah, yeah.

1137
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,114
Hey, guess what today is?

1138
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,701
No, no.
It's your friend Robert's birthday.

1139
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,831
He says he likes records,
so I got him "The Best of Bread".

1140
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,833
No, no, real records, like vinyl.

1141
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:58,171
<i>(MAN) I can tell you with certainty
what I did that night when it was my turn.</i>

1142
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:03,092
<i>But I think it would do little good,
because what the world remembers</i>

1143
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:06,804
<i>the actuality, the last revision,
is what counts, apparently.</i>

1144
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,558
<i>So how many times did it take Aaron</i>

1145
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,311
<i>as he cycled through
the same conversations</i>

1146

<i>lip-synching trivia over and over?</i>

1147
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,567
<i>How many times would it take
before he got it right?</i>

1148
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,486
<i>Three? Four?</i>

1149
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,113
<i>Twenty?</i>

1150
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:28,326
<i>I've decided to believe that only one more
would have done it.</i>

1151
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:31,370
<i>I can almost sleep at night
if there's only one more.</i>

1152
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:36,667
<i>Slowly and methodically
he reverse-engineered a perfect moment.</i>

1153
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:42,882
<i>He took from his surroundings what
was needed and made of it something more.</i>

1154
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:59,482
<i>And once the details
had been successfully navigated,</i>

1155
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:02,610
<i>there would be nothing left to do
but wait for the conflict.</i>

1156
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,117
<i>Maybe the obligatory
last-minute moral debate</i>

1157
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:13,037
<i>until the noise of the room
escalates into panic</i>

1158
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,207
<i>and background screams
as the gunman walks in.</i>

1159
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,629
<i>And eventually he must have got it perfect,
and it must have been beautiful</i>

1160
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:24,590
<i>with all the praise and adoration
he had coming.</i>

1161
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:27,134
<i>He had probably saved lives, after all.</i>

1162
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:32,181
<i>Who knows what would have happened
if he hadn't been there?</i>

1163
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,862
(AARON) Look...

1164
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,490
I know that things are bad, OK?

1165
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,787
I know that you don't agree
with what I've done.

1166
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:55,913
I know that you're upset,

1167
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,708
and to be honest I'm not too happy
with you, either, right now.

1168
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:03,254
But you know that this is going to pass.
So let's just go.

1169
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,275
Let's get out there. Let's go somewhere
where we don't speak the language.

1170
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,593
Aaron, we don't have
the money back here

1171
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,344
and we'd have to steal
our own passports.

1172
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,305
Money? We'll make money.

1173
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,850
They have sports betting in Vegas.
March madness?

1174
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,643
We'll make enough in one night
to finance a thousand vacations.

1175
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:20,605
- Passports.
- You know they're not using theirs anyways.

1176
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,814
(BANGING)

1177
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,276
Now, come on. I'm thinking Star City.
Check out the cosmonaut training grounds.

1178
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,402
(BANGING ON DOOR)

1179
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,029
I'm staying here.

1180
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,406
Why?

1181
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,700
(BANGING CONTINUES)

1182
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,853
(AARON) They'll be building
their own boxes in another day.

1183
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,171
And yours already knows
what they've built.

1184
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:47,465
You're not going to be able
to watch them forever.

1185
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,260
(ABE) The box Abe is building
won't work.

1186
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,971
He's got it wired wrong.

1187
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,476
And if they fix that,
I'll start actually taking pieces out of it.

1188
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,895
It's just a gimmick.
It doesn't work anymore.

1189
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,498
And your double will say
they have to move on to something else.

1190
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:07,485
- And mine will agree. They're friends.
- You're staying? Why?

1191
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,695
Why? Let's see,
why would Abe stay?

1192
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,490
What possible reason
could there be to be here?

1193
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:18,412
I guess that it just won't
go back far enough, will it?

1194
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,375
Tell you what,
why don't you take Kara and Lauren

1195
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,170
and put them in the box,
and then you and Aaron can each keep a set

1196
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,148
and you'll both have families
and you can stop feeding off it.

1197
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,567
- They'll come back.
- You can each keep a set in a hemisphere.

1198
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,844
And I don't think there's ever been
any reason to show you what I'm capable of

1199
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,471
but I'm telling you this now.

1200
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,682
Go out there
and do whatever the hell you want.

1201
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:39,934
There's no way in the world
I can stop you.

1202
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,812
But don't come back here,
and don't come near them.

1203
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,357
Any of them.

1204
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:05,126
<i>(MAN) Now I have repaid any debt
I may have owed you.</i>

1205
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,294
<i>You know all that I know.</i>

1206
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,798
<i>My voice is the only proof
that you will have of the truth of any of this.</i>

1207
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,551
<i>I might have written a letter
with my signature,</i>

1208
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,516
<i>but my handwriting
is not what it used to be.</i>

1209
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,513
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1210
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,517
<i>Maybe you've had the presence of mind
to record this.</i>

1211
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,102
<i>That's your prerogative.</i>

1212
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,146
<i>You will not be contacted by me again.</i>

1213
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:26,564
Good morning.

1214
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,484
Every half metre.

1215
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,278
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1216
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:33,696
Everywhere.

1217
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:35,614
Everywhere.

1218
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,159
<i>And if you look, you will not find me.</i>
